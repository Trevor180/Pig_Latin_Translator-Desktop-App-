![Pig Latin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea73df6e-52ef-49d5-a4f8-82ec609a3b99)


I developed an application that takes a sentence as input and translates each word into Pig Latin. In this version, the translation process involves removing the first letter of each word, placing it at the end,
and then adding the suffix "ay." For example:
English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY

**This was made in Winforms**
